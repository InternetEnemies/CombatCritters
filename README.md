#### Purpose

The purpose of our project was to make a fun, strategy based card game to play on the go, hence our vision statements success criteria: "This will be a success if players find it easier and more efficient than playing card games in person". This takes the idea of playing a card game like `Yu-Gi-Oh` or `Pokemon` and puts our own twist on it with the style of gameplay against the computer controlled battle opponents, and our card theme. We wanted to make something new and fresh because those two games have been around for a long time and we feel like they needed some more competition. Although we do not have physical cards to sell in stores like those two games, we think we have captured the essence of them fairly well with our own spin. This game is meant to be enjoyed by everyone that has an interest in strategy style cards games and we hope that this is the case!
