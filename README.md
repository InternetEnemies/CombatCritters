# Vision Statement

The purpose of Combat Critters is to let users engage with a fun and exciting deck management card game that allows you to build, manage, collect card decks, and even engage in battle with your favourite cards.

### What is Combat Critters?

Combat Critters is a deck management card game that includes a currency system to be used in our marketplace. Currency is obtained in various ways such as selling cards or winning battles. With this currency, users can buy new cards on the market place, building upon their own deck.

Users will be able to share their favourite, handcrafted decks with friends. They will also be able to request to trade cards with their friends if they are looking for an upgrade, or want to help their friends progress. 

Users can gain access to new cards with our trade up system. This allows them to always keep their decks fresh and lets them constantly progress. They can also open up various card packs that will grant them access to new cards to help them build out their personal decks.

### Who is Combat Critters for?

Combat Critters is designed for all people with an interest in cards, video games and battle. It will allow users of all age groups to collect their favourite cards and personalize their own battle decks. The simple design makes Combat Critters easy to use for anyone. Users can use their custom decks to battle against other decks and upon victory, they will gain rewards. 

### Why is Combat Critters valuable?

The project is valuable to users that enjoy card games but donâ€™t always have time to sit down and play at a table with friends. This project lets users play the game on the go whenever they have free time, rather than having to carry around physical cards. 

### How will Combat Critters be successful?

Our project will be considered successful if the 60% of users prefers using our game opposed to our competitors card games.
