# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## What went well
- It seems like we got a fair amount of work done, all things considered
- We got the foundations ready
- Spent a gross amount of time working :)


## What went poorly
- The frontend started work before the interfaces to the wrapper were well defined
- The Merge #2
- we had no way of testing the wrappers
- api routes never got tests
- the c# wrapper was started way too late
- Weren't able to fully complete the features we planned(but cmon, it's so much)
- Didn't do a good job defining what the management frontend was


## What needs to be improved for next sprint
- The wrappers should have the interface ready before the UI getting started
    - Have an interfaces merge before implementing
- I (Kevin) need to make smaller merge requests
- I (Somto) need to make smaller and individual commits.
- I (Somto) need to create issues to appropriately link commits to their issues.
- split presentation and wrapper integration for ui
- Whenever you create a new issue make sure to add time, priority, etc.
- I (Eric) should have delegated the C# wrapper sooner
- I (Hugo) should have the wrappers work done sooner
