# Vision & Summary

The purpose of Combat Critters is to let our audience engage with a simple, fun, and exciting deck management card game that allows them to collect and battle with their favourite cards.

### What is Combat Critters 2.0?

With the massive success of the first Combat Critters we have decided to bring our audience the new and improved Combat Critters 2.0. Combat Critters 2.0 is a deck management card game that allows players to build and manage their own custom deck of cards. After creating a deck that perfectly suits their needs, they can take it to battle against other online opponents. Our battles provide players with the same thrilling battle experience as playing the game with physical cards at a table. As players hone their skills in battle they can progressively move up our battle ranking system, and even become the best in the world. What’s more, players looking for higher stakes in their battles are able to wager their cards in battle against others.
In addition to wagering cards, Combat Critters 2.0 offers many other other ways in which players can collect cards. The one we are most excited for is our flea market. The flea market will enable players to browse through trade offers put up by others, as well as put up for trades of their own. These trades can consist of any combination of currency and cards.
The other main way of obtaining cards is through our digital vendors. These vendors offer daily trades that provide our users with more card collecting options. To make these vendors more engaging, you are able to level them up by trading with them. As they level up they will begin to offer new and exciting trades.
Combat Critters 2.0 will also feature an in depth profile system. With this system players will be able to add friends, feature their favourite decks on their profile for their friends to see, view and copy their friends decks, and even challenge their friends to a friendly battle.

### Who is Combat Critters 2.0 for?

Combat Critters 2.0 is designed primarily for individuals with an interest in trading cards and competitive gaming. It will allow players of all age groups to collect their favourite cards and personalize their own card decks. We expect our primary player demographic to be those of all ages with an interest in card games. Combat Critter’s simple and exciting design makes it suitable for everyone.

### Why is Combat Critters 2.0 valuable?

The platform is valuable to people who enjoy playing card games but may not always have time to sit down and play at a table with friends. We also want to provide an easy way to learn, yet an exciting experience to a wide range of people. This project allows anyone to play the game on the go whenever they have free time, rather than having to carry around physical cards. In addition, our vendors, flea market, and wagering system gives players a variety of ways to collect cards, granting them freedom in player expression with how they manage their deck.
Non-functional requirements
One non-functional requirement we will meet at the end of our project is the ability to handle one-hundred battles being fought simultaneously.

### How will Combat Critters 2.0 be successful?

We will consider Combat Critters 2.0 a success if one year after release we have one-hundred thousand daily users.

Combat Critters is a new and fun game for all!
