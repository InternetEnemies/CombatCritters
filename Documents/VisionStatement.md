# Vision Statement

The purpose of Combat Critters is to let our audience engage with a simple, fun, and exciting deckDetails management card game allowing them to collect and battle with their favourite cards.

### What is Combat Critters?

Combat Critters is a deckDetails management card game that allows players to build and manage their own custom deckDetails of cards. After creating a deckDetails that perfectly suits their needs, they can take it to battle against opponents. These opponents provide players with the same thrilling battle experience as playing the game with physical cards at a table. The increasing difficulty of these opponents also gives players a reason to progress their deckDetails.

With our currency system, players can fully curate their own deckDetails of cards to use in battle. Currency is obtained in various ways such as selling cards or winning battles. With this currency, players can buy new cards on the market place, building upon their own deckDetails.

Players will be able to share their favourite hand-crafted decks with friends. Additionally, they can request to trade cards with friends if they are looking for an upgrade or want to help their friend’s progress in the game.

Our trade-up system allows players to upgrade their cards, ensuring their decks stay fresh and always get stronger. They can also open up various card packs that will grant them access to new cards, helping them build out their personal decks.


### Who is Combat Critters for?

Combat Critters is designed primarily for individuals with an interest in trading cards and competitive gaming. It will allow players of all age groups to collect their favourite cards and personalize their own card decks. We fully expect our primary player demographic to be those of all ages with an interest in card games. Combat Critter’s simple and exciting design makes it suitable for everyone. 

### Why is Combat Critters valuable?

The platform is valuable to people who enjoy playing card games but may not always have time to sit down and play at a table with friends. We also want to provide an easy way to learn, yet an exciting experience to a wide range of people. This project allows anyone to play the game on the go whenever they have free time, rather than having to carry around physical cards. In addition, our marketplace and trading system gives players a variety of ways to collect cards, granting them freedom in player expression with how they manage their deckDetails.

### How will Combat Critters be successful?

Combat Critters’ success will be measured from multiple goals. Firstly, this will be a success if players find it easier and more efficient than playing card games in person. Secondly, our project will be considered successful if 60% of registered players are still actively playing our game within four months of release.
